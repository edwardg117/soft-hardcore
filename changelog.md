# Changelog
## V5.07
updated
- Xaero's Minimap
- Physics Mod

## V5.06
This may be the final update for a while. I'm looking at moving to a fully modded expirence and updating the original modpack. This will take me some time to do so only super important updates will come here rather than weekly updates.

updated
- Physics Mod
- Replay Mod Sodium Patch

## V5.05
Added Replay Mod. Currently not compatible with Sodium/Iris, this should be solved when the patch gets updated.

Physics Mod is now hosted on a new site I don't know how to download from, If you want to use it you're going to have to manually install it until I do https://minecraftphysicsmod.com/download

Also got the 3D Skin mod. I'm just trying it out, not sure if I'll keep it but it promises compatanility with Sodium/Iris and Optifine
