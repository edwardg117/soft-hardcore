## V6.00
Updated to Minecraft 1.18.1. If you want to continue on 1.17.1 you must press update or the game won't start, I'm not sure why it will let you try because Fabric needs to be updated.

No new mods at this time and listing every mod as being updated is silly, I also haven't updated any 1.17 mods and won't unless it's critical. 1.18.1 will be the supported version going forward.

The Tower Hunt event will start soon, I just need time to do some more things to the datapack and finish the next 6Sad for new years.

## V5.09
Critical fabric update to patch Log4j vulnerability.

Update immediately!

## v5.08
A quick note about the upcomming event: The goal is to kill the Ender Dragon but the potal must be opened by finsing 12 towers.

## V5.06
This may be the final update for a while. I'm looking at moving to a fully modded expirence and updating the original modpack. This will take me some time to do so only super important updates will come here rather than weekly updates.

updated
- Physics Mod
- Replay Mod Sodium Patch

## V5.05
Added Replay Mod. Currently not compatible with Sodium/Iris, this should be solved when the patch gets updated.

Physics Mod is now hosted on a new site I don't know how to download from, If you want to use it you're going to have to manually install it until I do https://minecraftphysicsmod.com/download

Also got the 3D Skin mod. I'm just trying it out, not sure if I'll keep it but it promises compatanility with Sodium/Iris and Optifine
